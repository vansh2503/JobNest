## Company Email Verification

The application uses email domain verification to confirm company affiliation - a realistic and industry-standard approach used by platforms like LinkedIn.

### How It Works

1. **Company Name**: User enters their company name
2. **Company Email**: User provides their company email address
3. **Domain Verification**: System checks if email domain matches company name
4. **Verification**: Confirms user's affiliation with the company

### Verification Process

#### **Step 1: Enter Company Information**
- Company name (e.g., "Acme Corporation")
- Company email (e.g., "john@acmecorp.com")

#### **Step 2: Domain Matching**
- System extracts domain from email (@acmecorp.com)
- Checks if domain contains company name keywords
- Validates domain-company name correlation

#### **Step 3: Verification Status**
- **‚úÖ Verified**: Domain matches company name
- **‚ùå Failed**: Domain doesn't match company name
- **üîÑ Verifying**: Processing verification

### Examples of Valid Company Emails

| Company Name | Valid Email | Domain Match |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| Acme Corporation | john@acmecorp.com | ‚úÖ acmecorp matches Acme |
| Tech Startup | sarah@techstartup.in | ‚úÖ techstartup matches Tech Startup |
| Infosys | rahul@infosys.com | ‚úÖ infosys matches Infosys |
| Tata Consultancy | priya@tcs.com | ‚úÖ tcs matches Tata Consultancy |
